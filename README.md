# BUSINESS OVERVIEW:
People have been relying on paper invoices for a very long time but these days, all
have become digital and so are invoices. Reconciling digital invoices is currently a man-made
job but this can be automated to avoid men spending hours on browsing through several
invoices and noting things down in a ledger. This project deals with detecting three
important classes from the invoices. They are:
1. Invoice number
2. Billing Date
3. Total amount
